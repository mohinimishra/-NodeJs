Hello, Welcome to nodejs

WE are learning file system

Synchronously copies src to dest. By default, dest is overwritten if it already exists. Returns undefined. Node.js makes no guarantees about the atomicity of the copy operation. If an error occurs after the destination file has been opened for writing, Node.js will attempt to remove the destination.

flags is an optional integer that specifies the behavior of the copy operation. It is possible to create a mask consisting of the bitwise OR of two or more values (e.g. fs.constants.COPYFILE_EXCL | fs.constants.COPYFILE_FICLONE).Synchronously copies src to dest. By default, dest is overwritten if it already exists. Returns undefined. Node.js makes no guarantees about the atomicity of the copy operation.
